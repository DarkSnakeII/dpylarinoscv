  My name is Dionisis, and I was born in 1998. I completed my undergraduate studies in Informatics at Ionian University and a Master’s degree in Digital Systems Security from the University of Piraeus. My native language is Greek, and I am fluent in English, holding the NOCN Level 1 Certificate in ESOL International. I have a strong interest in the field of Cybersecurity, particularly in penetration testing. I am passionate about identifying and analyzing vulnerabilities, assessing potential risks, and developing effective strategies to strengthen system resilience.

          The most intrested for me
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
               Ionian University: I have completed quite a few security themed projects most of them involved achieving basic security attacks. 
               
               Ionian University: My thesis was about security with a theoretical background, the title was "Issues and discrepancies in the implementation of information security incident response strategies and the role of the human factor"
               
               Univeristy of Piraeus: I completed a large coursework related to applied cryptography, Security Assessment and Exploitation of Weaknesses, Network Security, Mobile Internet Security, Digital Forensics and Security on the World Wide Web. Also, in a more theoretical level, I dealt with legislative aspects around security, such as ISO,NIST and GDPR.
               
               Univeristy of Piraeus: I have completed my master’s thesis, titled “CTF Forensic Challenges”, in which I designed a series of hands-on forensic Capture The Flag challenges. One challenge I particularly enjoyed creating focuses on log analysis of a machine infected with malware — the objective is to analyze logs, reconstruct the attack timeline, and extract indicators of compromise to drive forensic conclusions.

            I am currently working as a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst at KMICRO, a cybersecurity firm based in California. My responsibilities included monitoring SIEM alerts and security telemetry, performing triage and incident validation, conducting log and host-based analysis, and coordinating escalations to incident response teams. I regularly applied threat-hunting techniques to identify suspicious activity, produced actionable incident reports and remediation recommendations.

            In my free time I practice on Hack The Box, currently working on [📘 Active Directory Penetration Tester path](https://academy.hackthebox.com/path/preview/active-directory-penetration-tester){:target="_blank"}

          The first Greek University, the Ionian Academy, was founded in Corfu in 1824 and was the first modern-day Greek school of modern times and the academy of the United States of the Ionian Islands. The Department of Informatics has been operating since the academic year 2004-05. The subject of the Department is both theoretical and applied Informatics.

         Ionian University gave me knowledge and helped me improve my studying skills. I think the most important thing I gained was how to work on complicated tasks and other difficulties I faced, like security or code problems. All this research was quite a challenge but I finally managed to solve everything by efficiently using the knowledge I gained.

         This university is the second-oldest business school established in Greece, while the Department of Banking and Financial Management is the country's oldest academic department in the area of finance
        description: At the University of Piraeus I managed to work under strict deadlines and the most important thing I learned  is that in the field of security you have to constantly adapt to new data and new technologies and not rest on what is already known.
